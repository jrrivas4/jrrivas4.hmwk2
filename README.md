Homework Assignment 2

The Counter bash script initializes a variable called COUNTER and sets it equal to 0.  In the while loop it prints out "The counter is $COUNTER" replacing $COUNTER with the value of the variable.  Then adds one to the value of COUNTER.  This repeats while COUNTER is less than 10.   

The Second part changes the value of COUNTER to 20 and while greater then 10 prints out "counter $COUNTER".  Then it subtracts 1 from the value of COUNTER.
